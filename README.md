### Do you install WordPress many times? Do you transfer files via FTP?
 
**I have something simple and faster.** 

First You upload the install.php file to the root of the domain. 
Then you select the url yourdomain.com/install.php, choose the plugins you want to upload immediately (according to the most popular ones in 2024) and click install. In the folder where the install.php file was located, the latest version of WordPress will be downloaded directly from the official website wordpress.com, along with selected plug-ins also directly from the WordPress plug-in repository. 

You can also add your own plugins or replace them. Have fun! The installation process is certainly much faster than moving files and selecting them from the repository.

The installer is very simple, without unnecessary styles. After completion, the install.php file will be automatically deleted and we will be redirected to the further WordPress installation process.
